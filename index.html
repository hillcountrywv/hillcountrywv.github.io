                <paper-material elevation="1">
		  <p class="paper-font-body2">On behalf of the WVU Alumni Association and the Board of Directors, I want to 

congratulate you on your 10 year anniversary. I want to send a special thank you 

to Pattie Roe. It was her vision and drive that took the idea of an Austin chapter 

and made it a reality. Our local chapters are the bloodline to the University. You 

help engage alumni and recruit students, and you represent the flying WV with 

pride. Our move to the Big 12 put more of an emphasis on Texas. Your chapter 

has embraced the challenge. As a fellow Texan, it has been so exciting to watch 

the Texas alumni chapters grow and thrive. Mountaineers everywhere always 

look forward to our trip to Austin. Congratulations again!

                     <p>The Hill Country Mountaineers alumni chapter was established in September of 2005.</p>
                   <p>In mid 2004, a rather curious and definitely tenacious female residing in Austin (Pattie Roe), Texas posed the question, â€œcould I be the only WVU alum in Central Texas?â€ &nbsp;Surely not.&nbsp; So she set out to find an answer sending numerous e-mails requesting information to the alumni association office in Morgantown, WV.&nbsp; It took nearly a year to receive answers.&nbsp; But, not to be denied, this persistent individual finally secured the data and much to her surprise was blown away to learn that more than 250 WVU alums did exist in Central Texas.</p>
                     <p>After a series of steps to contact interested individuals, the very first meeting (in the summer of 2005) was scheduled in the Balcones Board Room at the Holiday Inn NW, Austin, TX â€“ four people showed up.&nbsp; The organizational meeting that followed on August 12, 2005 at the same location (Balcones Bd. Rm., HI NW) drew 13 people.&nbsp; At that meeting, a name for the chapter was decided upon based on suggestions including:&nbsp; WVU Centex, Waterloo, Hill Country Mountaineers, MOCT (Mountaineers of Central Texas), and Heart of Texas (HOT).&nbsp; Officers were named including:&nbsp; Pattie Roe, President; Ray Wandell, Vice President; April Wappes, Secretary-Treasurer and Betty Skaggs, Webmaster.</p>
                     <p>A few weeks later following the submission of our chapterâ€™s draft charter to the WVU Alumni Association, we received word that the charter was approved and the Hill Country Mountaineers became an official WVU alumni chapter in September of 2005.&nbsp; The chapter scheduled and announced its first football gamewatch event at The Legends Sports Bar &amp; Grill (Holiday Inn NW) for September 4, 2005.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; That was the season of the Sugar Bowl â€œshocker,â€ the amazing victory over Georgia with Pat White at quarterback and, of course, Coach Rod as head coach.</p>
